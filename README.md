# Dispersion Analysis and Simulations for Handling (DASH) of Future Fuels

## Project Description
The DASH project focused on developing an advanced multi-fidelity planning tool designed to predict the dispersion behaviour of ammonia and methanol during accidental leakages in bunkering operations.

## My role
My role involved integrating dispersion analysis techniques, performing consequence simulations, and leveraging real-time environmental data to build a comprehensive safety and risk management system. This innovative tool aims to support effective preventive measures, emergency response planning, and mitigation strategies, ensuring safer handling of next-generation maritime fuels.

## Notes
OpwnFOAM is required for the implementation of this project. The version used for my project is  OpenFOAM-v2012 https://www.openfoam.com/download/openfoam-installation-on-windows-10
